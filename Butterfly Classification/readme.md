### Overview
This project focuses on classifying different categories of butterflies using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with fine-tuning of the VGG16 architecture. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the model is trained to accurately distinguish between various species of butterflies based on input images. The dataset consists of a diverse collection of butterfly images, categorized into different classes representing various species. Each image in the dataset is labeled with the corresponding butterfly species, enabling supervised learning for the classification task.

### Model Architecture and Usage
The core of the classification system is a CNN architecture with VGG16 as its base model. By fine-tuning the pre-trained VGG16 model, the network learns to extract relevant features from butterfly images, facilitating accurate classification. To utilize the butterfly classification model, ensure Python and necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras) are installed. Download the dataset of butterfly images and organize them into appropriate directories. Fine-tune the VGG16 model on the butterfly dataset by running the provided training script. Evaluate the trained model's performance using the provided evaluation script. Utilize the trained model for butterfly classification tasks by feeding it with input images.
