<h2>Description</h2>
Welcome to my personal project on Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning! 
This project serves as a hands-on experience in the realm of deep learning, 
allowing me to explore various techniques and methodologies. 
By delving into the intricacies of deep learning, 
I've implemented cutting-edge techniques such as ImageDataGenerator, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and advanced methods like fine-tuning with VGG16 and VGG19 for transfer learning.

<h2>	:toolbox: Key Techniques and Features:</h2>
:arrow_right: ImageDataGenerator: Leveraged the power of ImageDataGenerator to augment and preprocess the lung X-ray images, enhancing the model's ability to learn and generalize from the data.
<br>:arrow_right: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Implemented custom CNN architectures tailored for the specific task of lung cancer detection, optimizing the network for accurate classification.
<br>:arrow_right: Fine-tuning with VGG16 and VGG19: Fine-tuned pre-trained VGG16 and VGG19 models, tapping into their deep knowledge representations and transfer learning capabilities to boost the model's performance significantly.

<h2>Deployment on Hugging Face using Gradio:</h2>
To share my work with the community and provide an interactive experience, I've deployed the Lung Cancer Detection app on Hugging Face using Gradio. 
This deployment allows users to easily upload lung X-ray images and receive instant predictions from the trained deep-learning model.
