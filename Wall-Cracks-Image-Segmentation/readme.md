This project focuses on segmenting cracks in wall images using a CNN model. The Jupyter Notebook provided guides you through the entire process from data preprocessing to model training and prediction. A Gradio interface is also included for easy interaction with the trained model.

## Project Stages 🚀
1. **Data Preparation** 🗂️
   - Load and preprocess the images and masks.
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Definition** 🧠
   - Define the U-Net architecture for image segmentation.
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and metrics.

3. **Model Training** 🔧
   - Train the U-Net model on the training dataset.
   - Validate the model using the validation dataset.
   - Save the trained model for future use.

4. **Prediction** 🔮
   - Preprocess new images for prediction.
   - Generate and visualize segmentation masks for new images.

5. **Gradio Interface** 🖼️
   - Implement a Gradio interface for easy image upload and mask generation.
   - Launch the interface to interact with the trained model.
